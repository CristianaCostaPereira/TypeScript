With lite-server installed:
<br>
1. ``nm i`` to created the node_modules;
2. ``npm start`` to run the project;
3. Select the project folder and run
<br>
``tsc --init`` to create the tsconfig.json file;
<br>
4. Then, ``tsc`` to compile its js file.
5. Finally ``tsc -w`` to start the TypeScript compilation process whenever a TS file is changed (dist folder created);
